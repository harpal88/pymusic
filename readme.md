ReadMe: Comprehensive MIDI Audio Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze MIDI audio performances by focusing on several critical musical factors such as Pitch Accuracy, Timing/Rhythm, Note Duration, Tempo Consistency, Dynamics, and Articulation. The analysis leverages advanced algorithms to evaluate and provide feedback on a user's performance against a predefined standard or reference.

Features
Pitch Analysis:

Detect and evaluate the accuracy of notes played against the reference.
Identify correct notes even when timing or dynamics differ slightly.
Timing/Rhythm Evaluation:

Analyze the onset times of notes to check for correct rhythm and alignment.
Assess tempo consistency across the performance.
Note Duration Analysis:

Evaluate whether notes are held for their expected duration.
Account for deviations due to tempo or articulation changes.
Dynamics Assessment:

Compare the intensity (volume) of notes against the reference.
Provide feedback on expressiveness and adherence to dynamic markings.
Articulation Style Check:

Identify staccato, legato, and other articulation styles.
Evaluate the smoothness or separation of note transitions.
Comprehensive Scoring:

Generate individual scores for pitch, dynamics, timing, and articulation.
Provide an overall performance score for consistency.


Requirements
Programming Language: Python 3.x


Dependencies:
librosa: For audio processing and feature extraction.
numpy: For numerical operations and analysis.
Input:
Reference audio file (e.g., WAV format).
User's performance audio file (e.g., WAV format).

Usage Instructions-
Installation
Clone the repository:


Install the required Python dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Analysis
Place the reference and user performance files in the audio_files/ directory.
Edit the main.py script to specify the file paths for the reference and user files:

reference_file = "audio_files/reference.wav"
user_file = "audio_files/user_performance.wav"

Run the script:
python main.py

Review the output for detailed analysis:
Scores for pitch, dynamics, timing, and articulation.
Detailed feedback for each factor.

Output
Individual Scores:

Pitch Accuracy: Score out of 10.
Timing Accuracy: Score out of 10.
Dynamics Accuracy: Score out of 10.
Articulation Style: Score out of 10.


Overall Performance Report:

A summary of the user's strengths and areas for improvement.
Suggestions for enhancing specific aspects of the performance.

Future Enhancements-
Visualization: Add graphs and charts to visualize pitch and dynamics deviations.
Real-Time Feedback: Implement a feature to analyze performances live.
Extended Articulation Analysis: Incorporate more articulation styles like marcato, tenuto, etc.
